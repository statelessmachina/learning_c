#Lab Exercises
The primary goal of this lab period is to get your C compiler up and running.

We have 2 “Hello, World!” examples for you to practice compiling to make sure that everything is working.

hello1/
hello2/

Compile hello1 with:

`gcc hello.c -o hello1`

Compile hello2 with:

`gcc main.c hello.c -o hello2`
